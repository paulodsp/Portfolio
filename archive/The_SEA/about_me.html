                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">I'm a designer of the future. I like helping to create new things both physical and digital to make a better world for all of us. I suppose it all started when I was working at my father's interior design and furniture retailing shop in my teens in London. I realised I didn't just want to help people with things for their lives that others had designed, I wanted to design things that others would want. When I finished my first degree in Aeronautical engineering and had my first child on the way - only 22 and already with lots of responsibilities on my young shoulders - I decided to apply to the Royal College of Art and study industrial design. That was the turning point in my life and outlook on the world. I started inventing things and learnt the art of design thinking - one of my projects was a roll up tablet with a touch screen and wireless communications built in, The Scroll I called it back then. Guess what? Something similar has just been launched at the CES 2013 show!<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Two years later, with a double masters in Industrial Design Engineering from the RCA and Imperial College, I had my first big break. Straight from my degree show I was offered the chance to head up the design team for Knoll Europe at their Italian offices in Foligno. Wow. I was off to work in the land of design - it was the time of Sottsass and all the best design was coming out of Europe then. A great job. I learnt Italian fast - none of the team of more than 20 young designers spoke a word of English - thankfully the common language of drawing helped until I could use Italian words as well as pictures to work with the team. I made some great friends and learned even more about the world of working and good design.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">In 1990 I was back in London and looking for a new opportunity. After a brief stint working with Priestman Goode bringing Sindy doll into the '90s for Hasbro and designing ovens for Stoves, I was persuaded to join the design team at Tesco. That was a strange moment. I really had no interest in the company up till then and thought that it was an atrocious place to shop. They convinced me that they wanted to design something new. It was a great 5 years. We turned Tesco into the No1. supermarket in the UK. I learnt all about retailing in the world of FMCG. I designed nearly every department in the store; worked on the latest designs for refrigeration units using central compression units and pushed the limits of merchandising - all for the benefit of the customer. We did many little things to improve the experience of shopping. We created the Metro brand and sold the idea for the first shop to the landlords in Covent Garden in a beauty contest with Georgio Armani. The store became the highest retail turnover per square foot shop in the world. I also worked with them on the beginnings of their journey into being an international brand - first in France and then Poland. <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">After 5 years I needed a change. I found myself at the beginning of the digital age. I took on the role of design and communications manager at a new mobile company, Orange. I was there for nearly 10 years, quickly rising to Global brand director and reporting to the CMO and executive board. I helped transform the company culture instilling the idea of brand values from the inside out, across every department. I led the creative teams at all the design and marketing agencies that worked with Orange in the UK creating unity of purpose; helped to create the youngest FSTE 100 company ever; launched and built the International marketing team and led them to launch the Orange brand in over 35 countries across the globe. We designed and patented the world's first mobile Video phone using GSM technologies and some clever video codec's; built 3D mobile online shops; ran international brand forums for all the country CEO's and top teams around the world and ushered in the world of multi platform services that we are now enjoying through all the connected devices that we use. After travelling the world for nearly 5 years, winning with my team the first ever Marketing Society Gold award for International Branding and working directly with the executive board through two changes of ownership (from Hutchison Whampoa, via Mannesman/Vodafone and the world's biggest corporate takeover to France Telecom), I set up the Brand Futures team. We built relationships, worked with MIT in Boston and Dublin and created new strategies for businesses in Wellbeing, Learning, Local communities, Time and Financial Planning and fun things in life. We designed and built new platforms and services in these areas with world leading research teams, including running clinical trials for a young persons diabetes service in Scotland. A crazy, brilliant time - what we could dream we did. Finally it was time to move on - I was ready for a new challenge.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">I joined my brother Dan and helped to grow the SEA (Science, Ecology, Art) where I'm now sole owner and creative managing director. We are an innovation agency that helps make the future tangible. We work in the areas of communications, technology, health and learning. We've built and launched our own ventures: Weglu - one of the first ever truly mobile centric social network platforms - and OOKL that supports visits to all places of culture for young learners and the general public - a new way of LOOKing! Other highlights include work with the UK government department for culture media and sport; helping Orange create it's group brand vision; putting Wanadoo on the couch to help them understand their brand and its culture using new techniques in semiotics and behavioural analysis; creating new interfaces for cross platform video bookmarking with US East Coast start ups; designing touch screen smartphones and interfaces for FT R&amp;D, collaborating with Channel 4 to launch Weglu on the back of the second series of Skins... and most recently with NEC designing their new global range of small cells for personal and business users.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Since 2009 I've also also been working with the Design Council as a design associate helping them deliver their Designing Demand programme to mentor and help UK businesses and public services grow.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">In the meantime I'm learning to be a better cook, husband and dad as well as continuously keeping up with the latest developments in technology and design. I read, travel, snowboard and dive when time allows. If you find things here that relate to your work and what you'd like to do then call me.<br /></p>
